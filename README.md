# py-calculator
This is my take at a calculator using python. 
please be proud of me Dakto


# Installation
1. Make sure you have python installed. 
2. Download the installer.py and move it into a folder. 
3. in a terminal run "python installer.py" 
4. the calculator should open by itself and create a Calculator.py 
the next time you want to use the calculator you can run it with "python calculator.py" from the folder 

i know i could have just skipped the installer and go straight to the calculator but i wanted to try and make an installer. so i did it in the worst way possible
