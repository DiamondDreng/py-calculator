# py-calculator
This is my take at a calculator using python
please be proud of me Dakto


# Installation
Make sure you have python installed.
Download the installer.py and move it into a folder.
in a terminal run "python installer.py"
the calculator should open by itself and create a Calculator.py
the next time you want to use the calculator you can run it with "python calculator.py" from the folder

i know i could have just skipped the installer and go straight to the calculator but i wanted to try and make an installer. so i did it in the worst way possible
